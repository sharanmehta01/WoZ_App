## Original User Request:
I want to build a wizard of oz site that generates interior design recommendations along with explanations. To do this, the landing page will have an intake questionnaire for new clients which I'll provide and the user can populate. Then I want to be able to receive those responses and use it to create a customer profile based on their budget, tastes, goals, needs, etc. I will use that profile to generate moodboards of designs we think they will like. We want to give them the option of chatting with us or providing feedback to refine the moodboards till we iterate and find something they like. Finally, after we settle on the moodboard, the third page will have specific design recommendations like colors, furnitures, decor, etc as an output along with explanations for why that recommendation matches their needs/goals/tastes/etc from profile.
